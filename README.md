# film
This is the first time I use laravel to build a website. I did a raw version of below requirement:

1. For the Backend, I did a RESTful API
Films have below fields:
  Name
  Description
  RealeaseDate
  Rating
  TicketPrice
  Country
  Genre
 
 2. For the Frontend, below are done:
   a) Created Exam.test/films to show all films
   b) Each film is shown through Exam.test/films/id
   c) Implemented Exam.test/films/create with form to create new film
 
 Further work can be done given more time.
